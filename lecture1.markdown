Quantum Mechanics
=================

- Quantum mechanics is strictly probablistic, this is because you cannot make a measurement of a system (experiment) without disturbing it.
- The elementary particles behave neither like particles nor waves, though share features of both. 
- All of these particles behave in the <i>same</i> way. 

Double-slit experiment

### Description as particles
- Given an initial source, say an electron gun, and a barrier with 2 slits in it that protects a second wall with a detection mechanism on it, what are the results. 
- The scenario is such that, as the source is spraying electrons, only a few end up making it through the 2 slits.
- This effect is measurable, at least in theory. 

- We can graph the rate at which particles/waves hit the wall parallel to and diagonal to ricochets from the slits in the inner wall. 
- If the detector plane on the second wall is at distance X, we can plot, or describe the rate at which it hits X. 
- The graph will have two humps in it, representing the two points at which the particles hit most frequently. 
- If we were to close slit 1, or slit2, we describe the two frequency rates at which particles hit the detector at point X individually as as N1(X) and N2(X). 
- These are the two functions describing rate according to slit 1 and slit 2. 
- If both slits are open we can describe the number of particles that hit plane X as <b>N12(X) = N1(X) + N2(X)</b>

### Description as waves
- If the particles coming out of the slits are thought of the waves, the outcomes are different. 
- The detector will determine the energy, or intensity at which the wave hits point X.
- However if we plot the Intensity simliar to how we described the particle version, we get an <b>interference pattern</b>, rather than a double hump. 
- This is because the waves have equidistant lengths to travel from their respective slits, and reach the detector X at the intervals according to their origin. 
- At some points there is constructive interference, at others there is near to complete destructive interference. 
- However if you were to only open one slit at a time, you get the expected humps similiar to the expected particle description. 
- Like the particle system I1(X) is the intensity at point X of slit 1, and I2(X) is the intensity at point X of slit2. 
- However, in this case I12(X) != I1(X) + I2(X)
- We can however describe the height of intensity as I(X) = h(X)^2, where h(X) is the height of the wave. 
- And the height at any given point when both slits are open is described as h12(X) = h1(X) + h2(X) 
- So we can say that <b>I12(X) = h12(X)^2</b> != h1(X)^2 + h2(X)^2
