Quantum Mechanics
=================

- Quantum mechanics is strictly probablistic, this is because you cannot make a measurement of a system (experiment) without disturbing it.
- The elementary particles behave neither like particles nor waves, though share features of both. 
- All of these particles behave in the <i>same</i> way. 

Double-slit experiment
---

- Given an initial source, say an electron gun, and a barrier with 2 slits in it that protects a second wall with a detection mechanism on it, what are the results. 
- The scenario is such that, as the source is spraying electrons, only a fiew end up making it through the 2 slits. Visualized below: 

            |     |     |   <- Wall with detection mechanism. 
            |     |     |
            |           |
    Source X      |     |
            |           |
            |     |     |
            |     |     |
