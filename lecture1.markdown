Quantum Mechanics
=================

- Quantum mechanics is strictly probablistic, this is because you cannot make a measurement of a system (experiment) without disturbing it.
- The elementary particles behave neither like particles nor waves, though share features of both. 
- All of these particles behave in the <i>same</i> way. 

Double-slit experiment

### Description as particles
- Given an initial source, say an electron gun, and a barrier with 2 slits in it that protects a second wall with a detection mechanism on it, what are the results. 
- The scenario is such that, as the source is spraying electrons, only a few end up making it through the 2 slits.
- This effect is measurable, at least in theory. 

- We can graph the rate at which particles/waves hit the wall parallel to and diagonal to ricochets from the slits in the inner wall. 
- If the detector plane on the second wall is at distance X, we can plot, or describe the rate at which it hits X. 
- The graph will have two humps in it, representing the two points at which the particles hit most frequently. 
- If we were to close slit 1, or slit2, we describe the two frequency rates at which particles hit the detector at point X individually as as N1(X) and N2(X). 
- These are the two functions describing rate according to slit 1 and slit 2. 
- If both slits are open we can describe the number of particles that hit plane X as N12(X) = N1(X) + N2(X)

### Description as waves
- If the particles coming out of the slits are thought of the waves, the outcomes are different. 
- The detector will determine the energy, or intensity at which the wave hits point X.
