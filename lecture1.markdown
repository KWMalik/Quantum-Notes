Quantum Mechanics
=================

- Quantum mechanics is strictly probablistic, this is because you cannot make a measurement of a system (experiment) without disturbing it.
- The elementary particles behave neither like particles nor waves, though share features of both. 
- All of these particles behave in the <i>same</i> way. 

Double-slit experiment
---

- Given an initial source, say an electron gun, and a barrier with 2 slits in it that protects a second wall with a detection mechanism on it, what are the results. 
- The scenario is such that, as the source is spraying electrons, only a few end up making it through the 2 slits.
- This effect is measurable, at least in theory. 

- We can graph the rate at which particles/waves hit the wall parallel to and diagonal to ricochets from the slits in the inner wall. 
- If the detector plane on the second wall is X, we can graph, or describe the rate at which it hits X.
