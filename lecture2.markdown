Principles of Quantum Computing 
===============================

- Quantization: certain quantities are oly allowed to take on a discrete set of values. 
- Basic chem (Energy of an electron in a atom); 
nucleus -> ground state -> first excited state -> second excited state
- Quantization occurs when the particle is confined. 

Superposition Axiom 
---
- Suppose we have a k-level quantum system 
> k distinguishable or classicle states for the system 
> Possible classical states |0>, |1>,.....|k-1>. 
- Superposition principle: if a system can be in one of k states, it can also be in any linear superposition of those k states. 
- Superposition can be described as: 

a = (alpha) amplitude probability a0 = a sub zero 
ai E C == "probability amplitude" 

> a0|0> + a1|1> + ... + ak|k-1> 
- The sum of the <i>squares</i> of these amplitudes is always 1. 
- (for k-1 sigma(ai)^2 where i=0) == 1

> if k = 3 
> 1/sqrt(3)|0> + 1/sqrt(3)|1> + 1/sqrt(3)|2> 
- Normalized since the sum of the squares = 3 (COOL!) 
- These are arbitrary <b>complex</b> numbers
- i can also = sqrt(-1) 
- this means that you can have
> 1/2|0> - 1/2|1> + (1/2 + i/2)|2>
