Quantum-Notes
=============

I enjoy learning, but have a bad habit of losing interest in a relatively short amount of time, ultimately forgetting it. 
I wanted to take notes, and share them, in an attempt to keep up with the free online course. 

By all means feel free to take part in and append or revise notes. 
The course itself can be found at the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/qcomp">Berkeley coursera</a> website.
